Commit emails(#Commit-emails)
==============================================

-   You should sign up for the SBND-COMMIT mailing list on listserv in
    the [same way as
    usual](https://listserv.fnal.gov/users.asp){.external}
-   You\'ll now get an email every time somebody pushes a commit to
    origin, fun!
-   I recommend diverting them to a folder that doesn\'t send you a
    notification and then just check them whenever you can be bothered.
-   What you do with them is up to you, you could enforce a strict
    coding style, request a better description of what the code does or
    just ignore them entirely and hope for the best.
