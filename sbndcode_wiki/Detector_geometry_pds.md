# Channel Mapping

The channel mapping of the PDS in SBND can be found below. Note that `TPC 0 is for x<0` and `TPC 1 is for x>0`. So the mapping is done in a way as if you were looking at the detector from behind TPC 0, from outside the detector. In a way that the channel number increases as Z increases for both APAs.
