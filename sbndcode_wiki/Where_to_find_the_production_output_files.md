Output(#Output)
================================

All productions are written to tape and must be accessed via SAM
datasets. The SAM definitions can be found in the links below and
instructions on how to use SAM definitions can be found at [How to
create and use a SAM
definition](_How_to_create_and_use_a_SAM_definition.html)

Old locations(#Old-locations)
==============================================

All output for all stages of older Monte Carlo production went to the
following location on dcache:\

    /pnfs/sbnd/persistent/sbndpro

\
The one exception to this is the very first preliminary MCC (MCC 0.5)
which was located here due to a blunder by the production manager:\

    /pnfs/sbnd/persistent/users/dbrailsf

\
Every production SBND has ever run is now stored on tape.
