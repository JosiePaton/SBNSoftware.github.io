SBND support group in ServiceNow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ServiceNow](https://fermi.service-now.com){.external} is the corporate
tool Fermilab Computing Division uses to keep track of and organise the
\"service\" work. We SBND users interact with it by [opening
tickets](Computing_resources.html#Opening-a-ticket-in-Fermilab-Service-Desk)
when we need something. Sometimes that something needs an action taken
from SBND itself, and the \"support group\" is the target for those
action requests. That means that a service desk ticket may at a certain
point be reassigned to the \"SBND support group\", that is a group of
people supposed to either know what to do (resolution), or to know and
contact who knows what to do (triage).

The people in this group will receive e-mails with ServiceNow tickets
assigned to the group, and are expected to take appropriate and
appropriately prompt^[1]^ action. The action will be most often to
forward the request to the appropriate SBND experts, to ensure that
there is progress toward a resolution and to keep the ticket and its
submitters updated.\
The [current members of SBND support
group](https://fermi.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=%2Fsys_user_group.do%3Fsys_id%3Dfe75d721db50db44a21c7c031f961956){.external}
can be seen from ServiceNow (search for \"SBND support\" among \"people
and places\"). To have new people added to the support group, a request
must be opened with a [ServiceNOW
ticket](Computing_resources.html#Opening-a-ticket-in-Fermilab-Service-Desk)
(instructions at [knowledge base item
\#0010719](https://fermi.service-now.com/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0010719){.external}).
