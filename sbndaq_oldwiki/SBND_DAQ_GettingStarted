title: SBND DAQ for the CRT \#\#
-----------------------------

open two terminal windows.  For each 
 - login as sbnd on sbnd-gateway01.fnal.gov
 - source "mstancar_launchdaq.sh" 
 
 In one window, type "DAQInterface"
 
 In the other window, look at the file "run" and find the line with setdaqcomps.sh
 The list of things that is there is all the things that will be included in the DAQ
 
 Type ./run to  start the run and type ./stop to stop the run
 
 The data will magically appear in /daq/scratch/data/
