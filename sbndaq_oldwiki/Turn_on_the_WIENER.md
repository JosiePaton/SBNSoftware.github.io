Turn on the WIENER
========================================================

AT DAB sometimes there\'s a power outage, you need to physically go
there and turn on the WIENER (silver-coloured box with a blue strip) on
the bottom of the TPC stand.

1.  Press ON/OFF button once UP (ON) to turn on chassis
2.  Press MODE SELECT button until you see U2 in the LED screen
3.  Press ON/OFF button UP once more to turn on power supply U2 (not
    Bono)

Generally the ON/OFF button must be pressed gently for a good second for
it to take effect
