Wish List and Requirements for SBN artdaq Based Run Control
==========================================================================================================================================

We use Esteban Cristaldo\'s
artdaq_runcontrol_gui\[\[<https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/artdaq-runcontrol-gui/wiki>\]\]
as a starting point for further development, requirements and \"wish
list\" items. *If you see your name here, we expect a response. If you
do not see your name here, please feel free to add your ideas.*

At this time this page is an informal document, but it may evolve into a
more formal requirements document in the future. For fun, I have
attached slides from an old CHEP conference about past Run Controls
<https://redmine.fnal.gov/redmine/attachments/52851/RunControlHistory.pdf>
or the final CDF RunControl Shifter training
<https://redmine.fnal.gov/redmine/attachments/52858/CDF_RC_Training_2011.08.09.pdf>.
Note that the lower left image on slide 1 of the CHEP slides would often
take several minutes to load!

-   A partition selection function prior to launching DAQInterface
-   Display of the currently active partitions with their locations,
    related to above
-   Have a \"display only\" mode where the user can see what is
    happening on a partition, but not control it
-   The ability to detach from an RC GUI leaving the DAQInterface
    running (GUI crash robustness)
-   And consequently a re-attach function to resume control of
    DAQInterface
-   A subcomponent status GUI \-- are BoardReaders, EVB, etc., happy or
    sad?
-   Simple state/transition flow diagram showing where we are in the
    state machine graphically
-   Ability to view contents of the configuration, component and boot
    files, in text and/or graphically

-   Stronger default configurations and fewer steps for shifters (i.e.
    just have the default DAQ configuration there when you open the GUI)
-   Optional selection of various config files (e.g. boot.txt) through
    the Qt file selector interface
-   Tighter integration with artdaq:

> -   It could potentially receive the messages from the different DAQ
>     processes and display important ones (the MessageViewer would then
>     be for experts). I did something like this for the VST.
> -   It seems sub-optimal to me that communication with DAQInterface is
>     done with a set of shell scripts. If DAQInterface could present a
>     C++ API, then the GUI couldl have more direct access to DAQ
>     processes.

I might be repeating what others have already stated, but in the
interest of setting priorities I write everything I can think of:

-   Make it more easy and streamlined to start up. More like click
    \"next\" a few times to resume the nominal or last run settings.

-   Make it play nice with other partitions and/or users, i.e. not try
    to kill everything.

-   Reduce the verbosity to stdout

-   Health window of the various subsystems and components

-   Ability to make and load various running profiles

-   \"Hearth beat\" to show status of connection

-   Show current on call expert contact information

-   Add various options for stopping, killing and purging processes

-   A bit of a premium feature would be to have some sort of support for
    showing alerts for smartphones, you know \'cause millennials

For more comparative fun, here\'s the SNO+ run control, which uses
[Orca](http://orca.physics.unc.edu/~markhowe/Orca_Help/Home.html).

Main features:

-   The GUI is independent of the actual data taking process and can
    detach/reattach. (In fact we do this all the time, remote shift
    stations open up a local copy of the GUI when we hand off, to avoid
    VNC slowness)
-   Normally in \"operator mode\" with limited access. A
    password-protected expert mode unlocks most GUI features. For some
    features, you must also switch to a maintenance run (in contrast to
    a physics run)
-   Standard Run types (physics, maintenance, various calibrations)
    which define a complete set of detector settings are selectable from
    a drop down menu
-   GUI shows important state (e.g. trigger channels enabled, channels
    at HV) and where these differ from run nominal settings in a
    database (handy, but at every run we also diff the current detector
    configuration against the standard definition and alarm on it)
-   Control of trigger, front end, and HV is integrated into the same
    GUI as run control

In addition to run control the same GUI is used to configure & control
the trigger and front end electronics as well as the HV, shown here:
