# How to send and receive beam signals on the WR network

On ALL server nodes (sbn-mi12, sbn-mi60, icarus-daq02) the software you
need is in this directory

    ~badgett/sbnddaq-readout/projects/wr/wr-starting-kit/spec-sw/tools/

The code is also in the artDAQ repository \[find out where!!!\]

When you list the files ik the directory, \"green\" are the executables.

To run any of these exe, type \" *./name-of-program \<parameters\>* \"\
To find out the syntax , type \"\_./name-of-program \--help\_ \"

Useful commands:

**to set a channel mode** in Input \[i or I\] or output \[d or D: \"
*./wr-dio-cmd wr0 mode 2 I* \" or \" *./wr-dio-cmd wr0 mode 3 D* \"

**to see signals timestamps** : \" *./wr-dio-cmd wr0 stamp* \"

**To broadcast a signal on the WR Network.**\
YOU NEED A SENDER NODE and (at least) A RECEIVER NODE

WE SEND beam signals FROM MI2 and MI60, so *sbn-mi12.fnal.gov* and
*sbn-mi60.fnal.gov* ARE SENDER nodes\
WE RECEIVE signals at ICARUS, on WR server *icarus-daq02.fnal.gov* and
on the SPEXI/DIO board in the NI crate in the trigger rack. So these are
destination nodes.

**What to do on a SENDER node ( ie sbn-mi12 or sbn-mi60 servers).**\
(see also section 6) whit the actual final implementation)

Suppose you have an input beam signal in DIO channel 4 (as on MI-12
DIO)\
a) first you have to set this channels to be an INPUT channel (to get
the signal from the LEMO cable INTO the DIO ): this is done with

*./wr-dio-cmd wr0 mode 4 I*

b\) to broadcast a signal you need to use the \"\_ wr-dio-ruler\_ \"
program with the following syntax (as example):

*./wr-dio-ruler wr0 IN4 L2+0.001 R4+0.000335 &*

this tells you that you are:\
setting up channel 4 as the INPUT (IN4)\
setting up a LOCAL channel L2 to \"spy/monitor\" the signal you are
sending\
sending the signal to a REMOTE channel R4 with a DELAY of .000320
microseconds

when you execute the \"ruler\" command, you get this message\
*\[root\@sbn-mi12 tools\]\# ./wr-dio-ruler wr0 IN4 L2+0.001 R4+0.000335
&\
\[1\] 117183\
\[root\@sbn-mi12 tools\]\# ./wr-dio-ruler: configured for local channel
2, delay 0.001000000\
./wr-dio-ruler: configured for remote channel 4, delay 0.000320000\
*

At this point (and each time you want to check the status of the signals
you are sending on the Network) you can run the \"wr-dio-cmd stamp\"
command to see that indeed you are getting a signal. So in this case if
you type *./wr-dio-cmd wr0 stamp* you get the output shown above .\
YOU WON\'T SEE \"ch 4 \" input anymore because is now \"sent\" to R4.\
That is why we make a copy on local \"ch 2 \" of the beam signals coming
IN on ch 4

At this point, when you type *./wr-dio-cmd wr0 stamp*, this is what you
see: PPS on ch 0, and a signal on Local ch 2.

**WHAT to do on a RECEIVER node with a SPEC/DIO card ( for example , on
icarus-daq02.fnal.gov)**

On the receiver node, to see the incoming signals, you need to start the
\" *wr-dio-agent* \" program as follows BEFORE starting the ruler on the
sending node

*./wr-dio-agent wr0 &*

After this is started , you can check the signals coming in with the
usual *./wr-dio-cmd wr0 stamp*

## OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION

A DIO card has 5 channels, numbered 0-4. Channel 0 is special and is
used ONLY for outputting the WR PPS. Channels 1-4 can be set as Input
\[i or I\] or Output \[d or D\], where upper case denotes a 50 Ohm
termination.

To set a channels in Input or output mode you use the *wrs-cmd-mode* .

For example:\
*./wr-cmd-mode wr0 1 I* sets Ch 1 in Input mode with 50 Ohm termination\
*./wr-cmd-mode wr0 4 D* sets Ch 4 as Output mode with 50 Ohm termination

It is also possible to use more channels to output the PPS, setting them
as \"output\" and using the *wr-cmd-pps* command as in the following
example:

*./wr-dio-cmd wr0 mode 3 D*\
*./wr-dio-pps 3*
