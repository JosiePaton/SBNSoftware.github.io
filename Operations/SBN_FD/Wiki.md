**Are you on shift FROM HOME soon?** As part of the response to the
COVID-19 situation, ICARUS has adopted a remote shift scheme where
shifters can perform duties from their computers. This current method
requires the shifters to get extra accounts and access. Here is what you
need to do to get ready for your *from-home shift*:

1.  Read the **[remote connection
    page](RemoteShift)**
    for details on how to get the extra accounts and access. Please
    **get the pre-requisite accounts ASAP** and check that you can
    successfully make the connections described in that page. You\'ll
    need them to carry out the different shift tasks.
2.  Read the *For shifters* section below, specially the *What to do
    while on shift* subsection. The information in those pages is still
    valid and discusses what shifters should monitor and do during their
    shift. You do not have to be an expert but you are expected to have
    revised this information in preparation to your shift.

Collaborators, shifters and experts: You are required to document all
activities and issues occurring during shifts and at the SBN Far
Detector (FD) by making an entry in the ICARUS ECL.

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that things on these pages are subject to
change due to the experiment\'s commissioning status and the evolving
COVID-19 situation.

### [What to do while on shift](What_to_do_on_shift)

Main page for shifters.

Monitoring tools and shift requirements are expected to change
frequently, specially during the commissioning period. So make sure to
**read the instructions in this subsection at least one day before the
start of your shift**, even if you have previously taken shifts.
Shifters are strongly encouraged to familiarise with the screen layouts
and tasks as early as possible. Either a current shifter or other
collaborator with previous experience will be happy to help you get up
to speed.
