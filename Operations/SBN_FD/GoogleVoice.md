### Introduction

Google Voice is a telephone service that allows calls and text messaging
from Google Number towards U.S. based numbers (both mobile and
landline). This service is linked to the Google Shifter Account and it
allows calls from a common telephone number charge-free for both
European and American shifters.\
One of the benefit of having a shifter\'s phone number is that in case
of need, the Main Control Room or esperiment experts can easily call the
shifter on duty.\
Although Google Voice can be accessed both by browser and mobile, the
latter solution cannot be used by the European Shfters.

**Account name:** [<shifticarus@gmail.com>]{.ul}\
**Password:** See ECL\
**Shifter\'s number:** +1 (631) 894-4173

## Setting up

Shifters are required to test their Google Voice connection prior the
their shift. Since the current shifter is already logged on, please
inform him/her of the incoming test.\
Login to Google Voice can be done via this link
[<https://voice.google.com/u/0/about>]{.ul} by clicking on the Sign in
button on the top right.

If you have never logged in the Shifter\'s Google Accout, it will be
necessary to click on `Add another account`; if you have already logged
in the past and the ICARUS FERMI account is present in the list, select
it.

If this your first time logging, you will be asked for a 6 digit code
necessary for the 2-Step Autenthication. The 6 digit code has the
following form **G-\#\#\#\#\#\#**, it is sent via text message to the
Shifter\'s number and it has a lifetime of 15 minutes. If it is not used
after that time, it will expire and a new code will be necessary. Once
the 6 digit code is sent, contact the current shifter to retrieve it.
The text message can be accessed by the shifter in the text messages
section of google voice (top left) and it was sent by the number 22000.
In order not to create confusion and misunderstanding, only one person
at the time should ask for the code since they are device-dependent.
Consider waiting for the shifter agreement before logging in since if
he/she is not available to forward the code, it might expire. It was
noticed that if too many codes expire, the device could be accidentally
placed in a \"black list\", if this is the case contact the Icarus Shift
Expert on duty.

If the login suceeded, you will be welcomed in the Google Voice
homepage.\
Before being ready to make a call, please be sure to allow the browser
to access microphone and audio, this can be done by clicking the headset
logo in the top right menu.

The settings pad will pop up and it will be possibile to select the
desirded device for audio or microphone and test it. If all the options
will be red and it will not be possible to change device, it might be
necessary to provide the permission to the browser via the Audio
Settings of the Computer. It was noted, that in some cases this option
was enabled only on the default browser.

Once the microphone and the audio are set up, it is possible to
make/receive calls. To perform a call, dial the phone number in the
numerical keypad on the right or, if the number was called by previous
shifters it can be accessed in the call history on the top left.

## Terms of use

The Google Voice should be used for the following tasks:\
\*Call the MCR at the beginning of the shift.\
\*Call the experts in case of need or receive calls from the experts. If
the expert does not pick up the call in time, he will be notified that
the shifter is in need he/she will call back as soon as possible.\
\*Receive calls from the Control Room or Beam experts.\
In order not to miss calls from the experts, it is highly suggested to
leave the Google Voice page open in the browser throughout the Shift.\
At the end of the shift, please log out of the account, in order not to
pick up by accident calls for the current shifter.\
It was noted in previous shifts that sometimes mobile can still be
connected in the background and this might cause inteference with the 6
digit code forwarding, for this reason it is necessary to be sure to be
logged off at the end of the shift. If you used Google Voice via mobile
throughout the Shift, once finished, please remind the Icarus Shift
Expert on duty to manually remove it from the devices list.

## FAQ

**Google code keeps asking for the 6 digit code after every login**\
*This issue still has no fix. The general understanding is that if
\"remember login\" is enabled on the browser, the 6 digit code should
stick with the device for some time, but it was noted by several
shifters (especially by shifters from Padova), that sometimes it does
not stick longer then a single session. This is still under
investigation, please report it to Francesco Poppi on Slack if this
issue is noticed.*

**Microphone/Audio not working**\
*It was noticed that some devices (especially Apple) enabled the
microphone/audio only on the default browser. The fix is trying a
different browser, if this does not help please report it to Francesco
Poppi on Slack.*

**The Verification code was sent to a specific device e.g. see following
picture**\
*This issue happened because a mobile was still connected to Google
Voice. If this happens, please contact the Shift Expert on duty in order
to manually disconnect the device and try again.*\
