## **General requirements for a remote shift**

This page is your main guide through your remote shift. It is
**definitely a nice bookmark to this page during your time in ICARUS**.
The page is organized in chronological steps to better serve the needs
and memory of the shifter in a quick and simple way. It won\'t be
exhaustive of all the potential issues a remote shifter may encounter.
Please refer to the provided links for additional resources or get in
touch with a `@icarus_shift_help` on Slack or the Commissioner/Run
coordinator.

**Remember that during a shift reaction time is precious! Take some time
in advance before your shift block to revise this material and don\'t
forget to skim through this page at any time you start a new shift and
verify if something new has been added!**

### **How do I know who is on shift?**

-   Who is currently on shift? Check the ECL [Who is on shift
    now](https://dbweb6.fnal.gov:8443/ECL/sbnfd/C/show_cur_shifts)
    section . You can also visit the \#icarus-shift-operations channel
    in the SBN Slack to find out who the current shifter is by scrolling
    through the messages.
-   Who will or has been on shift? Check the ECL [Shifts
    Calendar](https://dbweb6.fnal.gov:8443/ECL/sbnfd/C/show_month)
    .

### **If you\'re shifting remotely from your personal laptop (Standard conditions since March 2020)**

Carry out a remote shift is not a simple task and you\'re required to be
flexible and adapt your workflow and local environment to the
requirements of the shift. Here below there are some suggestions and
resources to make your shift experience smooth and nice:

1.  **Fermilab Windows account (mandatory)**
2.  **Fermilab service account (mandatory)**
3.  **Fermilab Unix account (mandatory)**
4.  **Fermilab VPN (mandatory)**
5.  **Browser Firefox or Chrome (recommended)**
6.  **Extra screen (recommended)**
7.  **OS: Linux or MacOSX (recommended)**
8.  **Slack account (mandatory) and desktop app (recommended)**
9.  **Remote desktop app (mandatory), see here some suggested choices**

Other shift resources:

-   **ROC WEST ZOOM**: Can be used for useful verbal communication
    bethween shifters and experts. The connection details are at the
    beginning of [DocDB
    15944](https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/RetrieveFile?docid=15944)
    (or in this [alternate
    link](https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=15944))

### **If you\'re shifting from a remote control room**

**At this time the ICARUS experiment is not supporting remote control
rooms**. Please make sure to have the contact of the person who setup
the control room in case of need or refer to the previous paragraph.

## **More than [6 weeks]{.ul} before your shift: [Request accounts and passwords!]{.ul}**

If you\'re not a Fermilab newbie and you took a shift within ICARUS
before, it is very likely you don\'t need this section. **Be sure
however that none of your accounts are about to expire in proximity with
your shift time and take the necessary steps to renew them with
sufficient advance**.

## **More than [1 week]{.ul} before your shift: [Shadow shift and test connections]{.ul}**

If you\'ve not taken any shift in the past **4 months** you\'re then
required to run a **shadow shift**. Instead, if you\'ve been on a shift
in the past 4 months, you are required to test your remote connections,
to make sure your accounts are properly set and take the necessary steps
to renew them or find a replacement shifter in case you\'re not able to
serve your shift.

ICARUS DOES NOT YET REQUIRE TO TAKE A SHADOW SHIFT

::: 
[Edit this
section](What_to_do_on_shift_new/edit?section=13){.icon-only

### **Test connections**

In order to test the connections, please try to complete the steps of
paragraphs [Bring up the remote
connection](https://cdcvs.fnal.govWhat_to_do_on_shift_new#Bring-up-the-remote-connections)
and [Setup
GoogleVoice](https://cdcvs.fnal.govWhat_to_do_on_shift_new#Setup-GoogleVoice).
Inform the sitting shifter on the `#icarus-shift-operation`, before you
start testing your connections and at the end.

Take action as soon as possible if you find connections that are not
working. `@icarus_shift_help` may provide support. **In case you need to
swap your shift:** please inform the Commissioning/Run Coordinator and
follow this information

### **Shift Check-in**

Please show up for your shift 15 minutes in advance. The very first step
you have to do are:

1.  **Communicate with the previous shifter** on the Slack channel
    `#icarus-shift-operation` and inform him of your arrival. Ask him to
    brief you about the detector and run condition and if issues have
    been encountered during the shift or experts have been called. If
    you have the chance to speak with the shifter in person or over the
    phone, please post a message on Slack `#icarus-shift-operation`
    channel, that you\'re ready to take over the shift.
2.  **Read the Bulletin board.** Along with the shift communication,
    make sure also to read the bulletin board and refresh your memory
    about the shift procedure.
3.  **Communicate with your shadow shifter** If you have a shadow
    shifter, make sure he\'s ready to shadow you.
4.  **Fill the [Shift
    Check-in](https://dbweb8.fnal.gov:8443/ECL/sbnfd/E/create_entry?f=Shift+Check-in)
    checklist**

### **Start Shift**

Now that you\'re well set for your shift you can

1.  **Call the Main Control Room** (if required) at +1 630 840 3721
2.  **Make sure your shadow shift is well set as well**
3.  **Fill the [Start shift
    form](https://dbweb8.fnal.gov:8443/ECL/sbnfd/E/create_entry?f=Start+Shift+Form)**

Congratulations!! You\'re now well set to start your shift. You\'re the
pilot of ICARUS at this point!

## **DURING YOUR SHIFT**

The duty of the shifter is to routinely check the status of the detector
and fill periodic checklists. Below is a list of the ECL forms that you
should fill out throughout your shift. It is your responsibility to fill
out all these forms during every shift. There are also other forms that
you should fill out in certain situations and others that will be filled
by experts. To fill up a form:

1.  Log into the ICARUS ECL.
2.  Click on *New entry*, in the left vertical menu.
3.  A new window will pop up.
4.  Select a form from the *Form* menu.
5.  Fill up the fields. Some comments to help you complete the form are
    shown on the right of each field. You may need to make the form
    pop-up window larger to see these instructions/comments.

**In addition, please make sure to make an ECL post regarding any
activity, anomaly or issue you encounter while on shift.**

**Run EventBuilder PDU check script from the terminal in Slow Controls
machine**

**Instructions**\
From a terminal in the Slow Controls VNC, run the command

    /home/nfs/howard/pdu_check/runCheckEvbPdu.sh

and report its result in the ECL. A suggested title would be \"Event
Builder PDU Check\"

Specifically, you want to check the results of the lines **EVB rack, PDU
Bank 1:** and **EVB rack, PDU Bank 2:**

**If the value reported in the line for Bank 1 is \> 20 A or the value
reported in the line for Bank 2 \> 2 A**, then call and alert the
Commissioning Coordinator (Angela Fava) or Deputy (Andrea Scarpelli),
whose numbers can be found on the Expert Call List.

## **AT THE END OF YOUR SHIFT**

It is your duty to remain on shift until the new shifter is well set.
**Inform the commissoning/run coordinators if shifter doesn\'t show up
after 15 minutes at the end of your shift to coordinate the transition
and make sure the shift after yours is well covered**

-   **When the new shift arrives** you should interact with him/her and
    communicate anything relevant that happened during your shift. At
    this point the incoming shifter will prepare the remote connections
    and log-in to the Google Voice account.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Pass down Google Voice code**: the incoming shifter requests the
    access code to Google Voice. This will happen at any new login since
    a two-factor authentication is in place. As the shifter before you
    did for you, you should send the code to the incoming shifter. The
    code can be found in the Google Voice main page under the received
    messages ( Click the message icon from the menu bar on the left side
    of the screen ). The code has the format G-\*\*\*\*. **Remember to
    log-out from the ICARUS Google account once the shifter confirms
    that he/she is well set!**

!(/redmine/attachments/download/63879/gvoice_messages.png)

-   **Fill the [Shift
    Check-out](https://dbweb8.fnal.gov:8443/ECL/sbnfd/E/create_entry?f=Shift+Check-out)
    form** once the incoming shifter is ready to take over

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Log off from the VNC sessions: \* please press the \*DISCONNECT**
    button in the top right corner of the VNC sessions before closing
    the Web browser (e.g. Firefox) tabs. It is in the NoVNC menu on the
    left side of the screen (it may be just an arrow that you have to
    click to expand). The disconnect button is on the bottom, see the
    [NoVNC
    Wiki](NoVNC)
    for slightly more info as needed!

Congratulations!!! You have completed you shift and you can now enjoy
the rest of your day ;)
