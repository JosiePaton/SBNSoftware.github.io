## **Shift swaps**

No shifter is assigned a shift block which they didn\'t chose during the
shift assignment questionnaire. Therefore, all the shifters are expected
to fulfil their responsibility to take their assigned shift. **Remember
that the experiment depends on shifters showing up to for their
shifts.**

However, if there was an **issue** resulting on a person unable to take
their allocated shift, that person should act as soon as possible to
find someone to cover them:

1.  The first action should be trying to find a substitute among their
    same institution peers.
2.  If 1 is not possible, the shifter should reach out to the
    collaboration at large and ask for someone to swap shifts with.
3.  If after trying 1 and 2 the shifter hasn\'t found a replacement or
    hasn\'t agreed on a shift swap, the shifter should email the
    commissioning or run coordinators (see the [shift bulletin
    board](Shift_Bulletin_Board)
    for the contact info) to inform about the situation.

**If an emergency occurs within less than 72 hours (3 days) prior to the
shift**, the person should skip the first 2 options and immediately take
action 3.

For a quick guide about shift swaps, please take a look at slide 14 of
the [Shift Assignment
Algorithm](https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/private/ShowDocument?docid=17443)
presentation.

    procedure and the shift swaps
