Hi all,
 
We have cut two new releases of sbncode this weekend.
 
sbncode v09_19_00_02 is a patch release to be used to make CAF files for the upcoming workshop:
 
* Make event weighting work for cosmics gen files (#110)
* CAF updates for ICARUS (#108)
* Improved flash-matching file error messages (#104)
 
sbncode v09_20_00 is a weekly release based on larsoft v09_20_00, and uses sbnanaobj v09_16_06, which adds class versions to StandardRecord objects, allowing for serialization/backwards compatibility moving forward.
 
Wes
