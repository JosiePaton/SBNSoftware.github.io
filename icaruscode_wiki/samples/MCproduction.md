description: ICARUS simulation samples
---

ICARUS simulation samples are produced under the umbrella of the SBN production team.

Samples are currently tracked on a database in the form of a [spreadsheet][MCDB].
Samples produced October 2020 and earlier were tracked in [ICARUS wiki](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/icarus-production/wiki/Status_of_MC_Production).

Some instructions on how to access sample files are provided in an [older ICARUS wiki page](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/sbn-analysis-group/wiki/How_to_access_ICARUS_sample):
