Setting up access with CILogon certificate
========================================================================================================

Take a look at [SBND
instructions](Setting_up_access_with_CILogon_certificate.html#Instructions-for-getting-a-CILogon-Certificate-and-importing-the-certificate-into-your-browser)
on the subject, but do not bother with registering the certificate with
DocDB, since you can use the [SSO
authentication](Access_to_SBN_DocDB_for_ICARUS_collaborators.html)
instead.
