title: Setting up access with CILogon certificate
---

Take a look at [SBND instructions](../sbndcode_wiki/Setting_up_access_with_CILogon_certificate.md)
on the subject, but do not bother with registering the certificate with
DocDB if you don't want to, since you can use any of the methods supported by
[Single Sign On (SSO) authentication](Access_to_SBN_DocDB_for_ICARUS_collaborators.md).
