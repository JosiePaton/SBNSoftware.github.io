Roles and people
=================

Release management
-------------------

Release managers build and publish the official releases of ICARUS code
([ICARUS LArSoft](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/icaruscode)).

Tracy Usher   | <usher@slac.stanford.edu>



Production management
----------------------

Production managers coordinate the production of samples (currently, imulation only).
The production documentation is kept in the dedicated Redmine project:
[ICARUS production](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/icarus-production)
(and [wiki](https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/icarus-production/wiki)).

Maya Wospakrik     | <wospakrk@fnal.gov>
Fran√ßois Drielsma  | <drielsma@slac.stanford.edu>


Fermilab Scientific Computing Division ICARUS liaison
------------------------------------------------------

This person is the preferred gate that Fermilab Scientific Computing Division (SCD) uses to communicate with the experiment.
It also works the other way around, with for example the liaison conveying ICARUS requests to SCD.

There is one liaison per experiment, who is usually a member of SCD _and_ a collaboration in the experiment.
Ours is also an over-expert of all computing aspects of ICARUS!
