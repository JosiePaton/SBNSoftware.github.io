title: If you need to synchronize run history records in the Online MongoDB with the Online UconDB, you may follow the procedure, as described below.
hero_height: is-small
---

_Note: This procedure runs incrementally and pushes run history records that exist in the Online MongoDB but are not yet transferred into the Online UconDB._

* Check out the latest sbndaq project code into your [MRB](https://sbnsoftware.github.io/sbn_online_wiki/Installation) area, run a build, followed by the ```mrb -i; mrbslp``` command that installs database tools into the ```$SBNDAQ_DIR/configDB_tools``` directory.

* Review [$HOME/.artdaq_database_tools.env](https://github.com/SBNSoftware/sbndaq/blob/feature/dbtools/configDB_tools/config/artdaq_database_tools.env.example) or create a new one if required. _Ask Wes or Gennadiy to send you a working copy of ```.artdaq_database_tools.env```._

* Setup the sbndaq product from the ```$MRB_TOP/localProducts_*``` directory and confirm that the ```xfer_run_history.sh``` script will execute from ```$MRB_TOP/localProducts_*```  by running the ```which xfer_run_history.sh``` command.

```bash
ups list -aK+ sbndaq -z $MRB_TOP/localProducts_*
#$ "sbndaq" "v1_00_01" "Linux64bit+3.10-2.17" "e20:prof:s112" ""
setup "sbndaq" "v1_00_01" -q "e20:prof:s112"
which xfer_run_history.sh
#$ ~/DAQ_DevAreas/DAQ_23Nov2021GAL/localProducts_sbndaq_v1_00_01_e20_prof_s112/sbndaq/v1_00_01/configDB_tools/xfer_run_history.sh
```

* Run import_run_history.sh.

```bash
$ xfer_run_history.sh
```

* Check the output for errors.

```bash
$ xfer_run_history.sh

_Note: Runs 826-828 were transferred to the Online UconDB with the first execution of ```xfer_run_history.sh```, and the second execution did nothing since the database was up to date. It is safe to run ```xfer_run_history.sh``` multiple times._
