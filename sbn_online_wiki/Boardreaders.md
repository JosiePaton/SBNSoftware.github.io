List made as a result of a request made on Jun 6, 2022 on the Online Meeting. 
- **lead developer** – refers to person familiar with the code, in particular the part responsible for communication with the hardware.
- **documentation** – We yet need to define what should be included in the documentation, and what criteria it should fulfil to be called "complete"
