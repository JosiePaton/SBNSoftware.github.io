### The SBN Program, LArTPC technology, Neutrino Physics

##### SBN

- The [SBN proposal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01520.pdf) sets out the program in a _huge_ amount of detail, this is useful when you want to find a particular piece of information, especially on the technical side.
- This [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04608.pdf) gives a much more managable size introduction to the program, including the physics motivation and a brief technical overview.

##### LArTPCs

- This [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/641257/attachments/1464825/2264132/20170523-LArTPCreconstruction.pdf) by Gianluca Petrillo from 2017 is a brilliant overview of the technical ideas behind a LArTPC _as well as_ a description of the standard simulation / reconstruction chain and the software we use to do this!
- This [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05824.pdf) from MicroBooNE gives a more detailed technical description of the design of a LArTPC and its various systems.

##### Neutrino Physics

- The SBN program's key goal is based around testing the short baseline anomaly reported by [LSND](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0104049.pdf) and [MiniBooNE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4809.pdf) so their original papers come in handy.
- This [reveiw](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1738523) article is long but gives a good overview of the current status of sterile neutrino searches.
- Another core topic to SBN is cross section measurements on liquid argon, this [review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.7513.pdf) describes neutrino cross section physics across the board, whilst [MicroBooNE](https://microboone.fnal.gov/documents-publications/) has reported on-argon results in multiple channels.
