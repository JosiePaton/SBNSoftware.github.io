---

For an extended tutorial on this subject from the Nov 2021 ICARUS Collaboration meeting, see https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/ShowDocument?docid=23982 (also recorded here: https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/ShowDocument?docid=24024). The tutorial goes through an example analysis module which parses some of the structure of the reconstruction output. The analysis module can be found here: https://github.com/SBNSoftware/icaruscode/tree/icarus-cm2021-tutorial/icaruscode/2021CMTutorial.
