# All those weird combinations of letters that everyone keeps saying...

*Please add any other acronym you know / come across!*

- **SBN** Short Baseline Neutrino (multi-detector physics program)
- **SBND** Short Baseline Near Detector
- **ICARUS** Imaging Cosmics And Rare Underground Signals
- **FNAL** Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab
- **BNB** Booster Neutrino Beam (the Fermilab neutrino beam on which SBN operates)
- **NuMI** Neutrinos at the Main Injector (a higher energy Fermilab beam which will also provide some off-axis data)

- **PR** Pull Request (a request to merge code into the develop branch)
- **POMS** Production Operations Management System (the system used to automise large amounts of the workload in producing large samples of events)
