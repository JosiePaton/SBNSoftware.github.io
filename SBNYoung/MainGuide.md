# Things we wish we'd known... SBN Young

So you've found this page, chances are that means you're a student or postdoc new to SBN. SBN Young is a group consisting of, and representing the interests of, all young collaborators of SBND and ICARUS.
This guide is intended to provide resources to help you get started in SBN. It's a compilation of any guides and documentation we could find / write ourselves and is by no means complete but we hope it helps you get up to speed!
Thanks to the authors of the SBND & ICARUS Newbie Guides from which we ported some of this information.

### The SBN Program, LArTPC technology, Neutrino Physics? 
Any of this new to you? Here are some helpful articles to get you going!
##### SBN
- The [SBN proposal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01520.pdf) sets out the program in a _huge_ amount of detail, this is useful when you want to find a particular piece of information, especially on the technical side.
- This [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04608.pdf) gives a much more managable size introduction to the program, including the physics motivation and a brief technical overview.
##### LArTPCs
- This [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/641257/attachments/1464825/2264132/20170523-LArTPCreconstruction.pdf) by Gianluca Petrillo from 2017 is a brilliant overview of the technical ideas behind a LArTPC _as well as_ a description of the standard simulation / reconstruction chain and the software we use to do this!
- This [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05824.pdf) from MicroBooNE gives a more detailed technical description of the design of a LArTPC and its various systems.
##### Neutrino Physics
- The SBN program's key goal is based around testing the short baseline anomaly reported by [LSND](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0104049.pdf) and [MiniBooNE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.4809.pdf) so their original papers come in handy.
- This [reveiw](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1738523) article is long but gives a good overview of the current status of sterile neutrino searches.
- Another core topic to SBN is cross section measurements on liquid argon, this [review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.7513.pdf) describes neutrino cross section physics across the board, whilst [MicroBooNE](https://microboone.fnal.gov/documents-publications/) has reported on-argon results in multiple channels.

### Communicating with the experiment
If you're a brand new grad student then the whole idea of how a particle physics collaboration works will be a new concept. The structure can seem a little bonkers but the easiest way to start getting to know how it all fits together is coming to meetings and getting to know who people are.
- All key information and connection details for relevant meetings will be sent out via the various mailing lists.
  - Let's start by subscribing you to the SBN Young mailing list!
  - Send an email to `listserv@fnal.gov` with no subject and just one line `SUBSCRIBE SBN-YOUNG FIRSTNAME LASTNAME`
  - The format is then the same for any other lists just replacing SBN-YOUNG with any other list. An (incomplete) list of SBND mailing lists can be found [here](https://sbn-nd.fnal.gov/internal/mailing_lists.html) and _TODO ICARUS MAILING LISTS_
- There is an SBN-wide [slack](https://shortbaseline.slack.com/) workspace. This is where most day-to-day conversations happen. You should be able to find anyone on the experiment here, there are also channels for different groups within the experiments which you can join (e.g. #sbn-young)
- All important documents, including slides from all internal meetings can be found on the [docDB](https://sbn-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/sso/DocumentDatabase), you should be able to access this through Fermilab's single sign on once you have your services account (see below).
- 
### Computing Access
- One of the very first things you'll need to do is [apply](https://fermi.servicenowservices.com/wp/?id=evg_sc_cat_item&sys_id=d361073881218500bea3634b5c987c4c) for a Fermilab computing account for your experiment.
- This will give you a services password (for logging into most Fermilab online resources) and a kerberos password which you use to indentify your computer to the Fermilab servers you will be logging into.
- There are detailed instruction of how to ssh into the appropriate virtual machines for your experiment in the [SBND](https://sbnsoftware.github.io/sbndcode_wiki/Computing_resources.html) and [ICARUS](https://sbnsoftware.github.io/icaruscode_wiki/Computing_Resources.html) pages.

_TODOs
- Software section (LArSoft, ROOT etc as well as sbn specific stuff, again can be heavily linked to experiment pages)
- Basic explaination of the stages of the sim-reco chain (sounds super basic but I never really got this explained at all)
- List of important people in each experiment (Spokes, IB chairs, WG conveners etc) obviously you're not immediately going to be interact with many/all of them but I think it helps to feel part of what's going on if you recognise names
- Maybe a description of what some of the key working groups do (linked to the above perhaps?)
