# Simulation software for SBN
### CORSIKA 
CORSIKA is SBN's adopted Monte Carlo (MC) simulation package for generating cosmogenic particles. CORSIKA simulates detailed air showers initiated by highly energetic cosmic particles. More information about CORSIKA is available here: https://www.iap.kit.edu/corsika/. 


### G4
Geant4 (g4) uses Monte Carlo methods to simulate "the passage of particles through matter". More information on G4 is available here: https://geant4.web.cern.ch/node/1

TODO: Include explanation of simulation chain for sbn
 
1. Gen Stage: create some events
2. G4 Stage: propogate particles through detector
